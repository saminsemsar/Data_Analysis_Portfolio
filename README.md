## Overview

This portfolio contains two comprehensive data analysis projects:
1. **Baby Data Analysis**: Focusing on clustering and exploratory data analysis for neonatal health data.
2. **Predictive Policing Bias Analysis**: A simulation-based analysis of bias in predictive policing models (KDE vs PredPol) using real-world crime data.

These projects highlight my ability to work with large datasets, apply machine learning techniques, and draw actionable insights through detailed statistical analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis on 8 Babies' Vital Signs

This project explores baby health data, focusing on preprocessing, clustering, and extracting insights related to demographic factors like weight and age.

### Notebooks:
- [Data Preprocessing](./VitalSignsEDA/babyData_preprocessing.ipynb)
- [Clustering the Babies](./VitalSignsEDA/clustering_the_babies.ipynb)
- [Exploratory Analysis](./VitalSignsEDA/Exploratory_analysis_on_the_results.ipynb)

### Key Highlights:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and transformed raw data for analysis.
- **Clustering**: Applied clustering algorithms to identify health patterns among babies.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualized the data using statistical plots and trends.

## Predictive Policing Bias Analysis

This project compares Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) and PredPol models to understand the biases in police resource allocation. The models are evaluated for their tendency to over-police or under-police neighborhoods based on racial and geographical factors.

### Notebooks:
- [Data Preprocessing](./PredictivePolicing/Data_Preprocessing.ipynb)
- [KDE vs PredPol Model Development](./PredictivePolicing/KDE_and_PredPol.ipynb)
- [Analysis Results](./PredictivePolicing/Analyzing_Results_DateBased.ipynb)

### Key Highlights:
- **Predictive Modeling**: Built KDE and PredPol models to simulate police resource distribution.
- **Bias Analysis**: Identified trends of over- and under-policing across neighborhoods, comparing both models.
- **Visualization**: Used time-series plots, variance analysis, and trendline fitting to reveal patterns in police resource allocation.

## Skills Demonstrated

Through these projects, I have applied the following skills:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Efficiently cleaning and organizing raw datasets.
- **Clustering & Statistical Analysis**: Implemented machine learning algorithms like k-means for clustering, and applied statistical methods for data analysis.
- **Time-Series & Bias Detection**: Analyzed temporal data and modeled predictive policing biases over time.
- **Visualization**: Leveraged Python libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and pandas for effective data visualization.
